============================== optaplanner devconf workshop 2015 ==============================

--- TASK 1 ---
1. open project in java IDE you've selected (just click on parent pom.xml)
2. open module called cloudbalance-easymodel
3. search for src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/domain package and get familiar with java classes

--- TASK 2 ---
4. open src/main/resources/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml 
5. execute runEasy.sh (or runEasy.bat), pick (TED MUSIME VYBRAT JAKY PRESNY SCENAR) and see what planner does 
6. try to uncomment "localsearch" section in cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml and do step 5. again
7. observe the difference

--- TASK 3 ---
8. open module called cloudbalance-sophisticated
9. search for src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/domain package and get familiar with java classes
   9a. there are extra annotations
   9b. there are extra files (comparators)
   9c. run construction heuristic only and compare the difference
10.  search for src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/score 
   10a. check EasyScore score function and IncrementalScoreFunction
   10b. in cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml try speed difference between easy and incremental score calculation

--- TASK 4 --- (optional)
11. pick one score calculation (We strongly recommend EasyScoreCalculation, DRLscoreCalculation is also possible)
12. add a new hard constraint: no computer should have more than 4 processes assigned to it
